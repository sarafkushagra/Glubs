## Project Structure

The repository is a monorepo containing the `frontend` and `backend` services.

### Backend Structure

The backend follows a modified MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for separation of concerns and maintainability.

```

├── middlewares/    # Custom middlewares (e.g., isAuthenticated, restrictTo)
├── routers/        # Defines API routes for different resources
├── schema/         # Mongoose schemas for database models
└── utils/          # Utility functions (error handling, email sending, etc.)
```

### Frontend Structure

The frontend is built with React and Vite, organized by feature-based components.

```
